							<h3>Why I love being a Westpac Young Technologist Scholar</h3>
							
							<p>Being awarded a Westpac Young Technologist Scholarship has honestly been one of my greatest achievements to date. 
							It has been a great learning experience so far, and I cannot put a value on how much it has enhanced my journey so far.</p>
							
							<p>I believe it speaks volumes that Westpac has provided me with this opportunity as a scholar,and with this in the back 
							of my mind I can safely forge ahead in all my endeavours with the confidence that I am supported by Westpac as a mentor.</p>
							
							<p>I can’t understate the close group that has formed among the 2017 scholars. Since the first introduction we all really 
							clicked and have become good friends. We share the same passion for this field and have similar interests, allowing for an 
							organic relationship to form, and as we all grow and gain experience, this network will undoubtedly grow stronger.</p>
							
							<p>I am extremely thankful that this has been the case, and appreciate Westpac offering this scholarship that brings
							like-minded individuals together in such a way. The financial aspect of this scholarship has allowed me to be financially
							secure and pursue any opportunities in the technology field that I wish to (eg this internship!). It relieves financial pressure
							off me and allows me to focus on my university studies and improving myself.</p>
							
							<p>I love everything about the scholarship to be frank, and am proud to a Westpac Young Technologist.</p>

							<h3>Why I am passionate about technology</h3>
							
							<p>Since I was little I have had a passion for technology and everything in the realm. I attribute this partially to my older
							brothers who are similar minded and naturally surrounded me with technology and games at a young age.</p>
							
							<p>This inkling flourished when I was in year 12 and studying Software Development. I had a taste of the industry and everything
							from web development to project management, and this solidified my choice to make Computer Science my first preference for university.
							Since then I have enjoyed my time at university, and believe I made the right choice to pursue a career in technology.</p>
							
							<p>In a nutshell, technology and software development in particular, is all about problem solving, which suits my nature extremely
							well. I have a genuine interest to help people and answer the issues that are present in the world.</p>
							
							<p>With a career in computer science, I feel I have a great opportunity to realise this. I see the power of my work in computer science
							and the effects that technology can have on virtually every aspect of day-to-day life, and believe I can have a real impact with my skills and experience.</p>
							
							<p>I must say, I have most enjoyed the web development units I have undertaken so far and love the creativity and freedom it
							allows from a development standpoint. This field of technology pairs well with my aforementioned problem-solver mentality, and this
							is likely why I have so much fun in this particular line of work. </p>

							<h3>What role I want to play in the future of technology for creating a better Australia</h3>
							
							<p>At university I am undertaking a minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation as I have always had the dream of owning my own business,
							and for the longest time during high school was fixed on a business degree.</p>
							
							<p>If I am to work in this space, I feel there is a great opportunity to affect the future of technology in Australia at effectively
							ground zero. With startups across the country developing many different products and services, the possibilities for creating a better
							Australia are endless. This is where I want to be ultimately, working in close proximity to change at any level, with real people and real effects.</p>
							
							<p>No offense to anyone, but I don’t exactly want to be a code monkey or spend all day in a cubicle. I want to get out in the world
							and travel to places where my skills have a use.</p>
							
							<p>I want to have an active role in the technology industry, whether that be on a large scale with some widely successful product, or on
							a smaller scale with say a community outreach program. It sounds cheesy, but that’s where my vision lies. </p>

							<h3>What I know about technology at Westpac</h3>
							
							<p>I have to say, I don’t know a great deal about technology at Westpac. However, I see this as an opportunity for growth and for my horizons
							to be expanded immensely in any direction. I am an open book when it comes to this knowledge, and would love to be fully immersed in an
							environment such as this internship program, surrounded by endless resources and brains to pick where I can learn so much in a short amount of time.</p>
							
							<p> From my time in Sydney at the Scholar Summit last year, I saw how wide of a breadth Westpac has in this industry, and that they operate globally.
							There is obviously a huge impact on the world that can be attributed to Westpac’s many programs, and there is a reason why they’re one of the big four.</p>
							
							<p>Furthermore, with the opportunities they are providing for individuals around Australia with their scholarship programs, I can see how the effects would
							flow throughout so many communities and avenues</p>
