							<h3>Seeking an internship in the Westpac Group Technology division</h3>
							
							<p>I wish to apply for the position of intern at the Sydney Westpac offices.</p>
							
							<p>After carefully reading the program sent to me by Jimmy, I believe that the
							qualities you are seeking are the same qualities that I have applied to my studies
							and personal life. I am currently completing my second year of a bachelor’s degree
							in computer science at Swinburne University of Technology, with a major in Software
							Development and minor of Entrepreneurship.</p>
							
							<p>I am committed to succeeding in the technology field, which is why I have applied 
							for this internship - and why I am a Young Technologist in the first place. As a career
							opportunity it seems invaluable, and for my personal growth I believe it would have an
							immense effect. The potential of the experience on offer is huge, and matches my
							expectations for what an internship should be.</p>
							
							<p>I have gained relevant work experience this year in my capstone unit,
							‘Software Engineering Project’. This involves working in a small team on a year-long
							project for a real-world client (ours being French multinational, Thales). This unit
							is designed to replicate the operations of an actual group, such as that of the Group
							Technology team, and so far has proven to be extremely rewarding in the experience and
							knowledge I have gained.</p>
							
							<p>Accompanied in this site is my academic transcript. After struggling in introduction
							to university, I have strived to improve my results in my second year and believe I am
							on track for the results I’m after given the effort I have put in.</p>
							
							<p>I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.</p>
							
							<p>Yours sincerely, Nick.</p>
